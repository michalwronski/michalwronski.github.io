## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution,
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you have already submitted

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

### Formatting

We use [prettier][4] to format Markdown, JavaScript, and (most) HTML, in order
to ensure a consistent style throughout our source. You can add prettier as a
plugin in most development environments.
