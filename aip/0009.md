# Glossary

In the name of brevity, this AIP defines some common terminology here rather
than in each AIP individually.

## Guidance

The following terminology **should** be used consistently throughout AIPs.

API
: Application Programming Interface. This can be a local interface (such as a
  client library) or a Network API (defined below).

API Request
: A single invocation of an API Method. It is often used as the unit for
  billing, logging, monitoring, and rate limiting.
