# Frequently asked questions

**Note:** Have a question not answered here? [Ask us on GitHub!][bug]

### I like most of these AIPs, but some make no sense for me. What do I do?

Sometimes guidance from AIPs makes lots of sense for Google (perhaps due to its
size or scale) but no sense at all for others. This is much more common than we
originally thought, so we added a way for sub-teams to override guidance that
doesn't make sense for those teams.

If you want to adopt most of the AIPs but have a few that make no sense for
your team, you can override those few and stick to just the ones that make
sense for you.

### I have a question that isn't answered here. What do I do?

We're still pretty new and haven't built up a long list of frequently asked
questions, so if you have a question not answered here, you can always [ask us
on GitHub][bug] by filing an issue.

And if you already know the answer to a question that would be helpful for
others, [send us a pull request adding it to this page][pull request]!
