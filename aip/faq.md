# Frequently asked questions

**Note:** Have a question not answered here? [Ask us on GitHub!][bug]

### I like most of these AIPs, but some make no sense for me. What do I do?

If you want to adopt most of the AIPs but have a few that make no sense for
your team, you can override those few and stick to just the ones that make
sense for you.

### I have a question that isn't answered here. What do I do?

We're still pretty new and haven't built up a long list of frequently asked
questions, so if you have a question not answered here, you can always [ask us
on GitHub][bug] by filing an issue.

And if you already know the answer to a question that would be helpful for
others, [send us a pull request adding it to this page][pull request]!
