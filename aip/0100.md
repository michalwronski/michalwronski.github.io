# API Design Review FAQ

API design review exists to ensure a simple, intuitive, and consistent API
experience throughout our API corpus.

## Do I need API design approval?

**TL;DR:** You usually need API design approval if you are launching an API
that users can code against (either now or in the future) at the beta or GA
quality level.

API design review is fundamentally about ensuring we provide a simple and
consistent experience for our users, and therefore is only expected for APIs
that users code directly against.
